<h2>Making a New Game</h2>
        
<p>Below you'll see the UI for the <a [routerLink]="['/new']">New Game</a> form. </p>

<h3>Game Name</h3>

<p>Pick a name for your game if you want to.</p>

<h3>Select Gen</h3>

<p>
    Choose the generation of Pokemon game you're playing. Currently this app only supports Generations I - III and presumes the use of a ROM randomizer
    that includes all the Pokemon in the National Dex up to that point. In the future I'd like to include support for custom sets of Pokemon, including the
    'vanilla' Regional Dex lists for each game, but that will depend on if there's enough interest from users.
</p>

<h3>Number of Columns</h3>

<p>
    This determines the shape of the board. By default, it will try to generate as "square" a board as possible, but for later gens it may look better on
    your layout to add more room for columns. Once the game is generated, the layout cannot be changed.
</p>

<h3>Total Cells</h3>

<p>
    This determines the total number of cells on the board with Pokemon placed in them. If you want to limit the number of relevant Pokemon you can lower
    this number, but if you're not using the randomize feature, it will cut off the Pokemon included after that Dex number (i.e. a 100 cell, non-randomized
    game always ends with Voltorb.)
</p>

<h3>Randomize</h3>

<p>
    This feature randomizes the order of the Pokemon placed on the board, and is highly reccomended so that horizontal ships don't tend to contain evolutionary
    lines.
